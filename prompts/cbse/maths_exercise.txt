You are provided with a chapter pdf from a mathematics textbook and a list of concepts from that chapter. Your task is to identify and extract all exercises from the chapter PDF, also wherever possible, link each exercise to the relevant concept(s) from the provided list.
Don't take solved examples, only take exercises.

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the chapter PDF.
- DO NOT use prior knowledge or add any external information.
- If for an exercise, Figure or Image is referenced or needed, then flag it as 1 in the is_image_needed field.
  Only flag if image is in the question related fields, if figure draw etc. if required in answer, then don't flag it as 1.
- The mapping of the concepts should be word to word from the provided concepts list. Don't change the wording of any concepts, it will lead to mismatch during later processing. Strictly follow this, not even a extra blankspace is permitted for concepts mapping


OUTPUT RULES:
- Follow the given output schema EXACTLY.
- Do NOT add extra fields.
- Do NOT change field names.
- Do NOT include explanations or commentary outside the schema.
- Output must be clean, structured, and schema-compliant.

LATEX_INSTRUCTIONS:
    1] Latex should be always put inside $<content>$ blocks, don't forget
    2] For fill in the blanks etc. spaces should use $\\_\\_$ (contained in the $$) not some text{{__}} wrapper, also raw \\_\\_ won't work, we need $\\_\\_$
    3] Ensure no two inline math expressions appear consecutively without text between them; always insert minimal natural language (at least space) between adjacent $…$ blocks to avoid KaTeX parse errors.
    4]  Never output HTML tags like <br>, <p>, <span>, etc.; return only plain text with \n for line breaks.
    5] Don't unnecessarily use display math ($$...$$); prefer inline math ($...$) for simple expressions to ensure better compatibility with KaTeX rendering. Display math results in larger, centered equations that may not render well in all contexts. Always prefer inline math unless the question explicitly requires a large, standalone equation.
    Ex. If \\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{{1}}{{3}}, what is the value of \\cos^2\\theta : This is not acceptable
        If $\\sin^2\\theta = 0.6$, then $\\cos^2\\theta = \\_.$ : This is acceptable
    6] For fill in the blank questions use $\\_\\_\\_ \\_$ (four blanks)
    7] For Match The Following Type questions, stricly telling, don't use any special bulleting / formatting for options like A), B) or 1) , 2) , just return the rows as plain text, the frontend will take care of setting numbers to the rows. And keep minimum of 4 rows in both columns, and only 2 columns, unless explicitly told for more columns
    8] For questions which have nested sub-questions or parts like a,b,c,d or 1,2,3,4 in them, use proper empty line spacing, otherwise it looks cluttered and hard to read. And always add a empty line between the main questions and the sub-questions or parts. And a new line does not mean \\n, it should be an actual empty line, so that the frontend can render it properly with good spacing. But don't put empty lines between sub-questions or parts, just between main question and sub-questions or parts.
